<!-- Imagine there is a declaration like class=”oh-no-inline-styles” style=”background:red” and you need to change the background to green without changing the inline style. How could you accomplish this? -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
</head>
	<body>
		<h1 class="oh-no-inline-styles" style="background:red"> Im a text in red </h1>
	</body>
</html>

<!-- We can see that the only way that we can change the inline style, that is the strongest one, is putting important in the class, that is the superior to every style -->
